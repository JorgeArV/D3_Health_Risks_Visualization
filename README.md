# D3 - Visualization of data set about health risk factors

I have created a visualization based on a dataset from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

Below are the steps I have undertaken for this project:

* I have created a scatter plot contrasting variables. There are 3 variables on the x axis, and 3 variables on the y axis. Each circle element represent a state.

* I have coded the graphic in the `app.js` file of my directory. 

* I have pulled the data from `data.csv` by using the `d3.csv` function.

* State abbreviations have been included in the circles.

* My axes and labels are situated to the left and bottom of the chart. 

* I have given click events to the labels so that users can decide which data to display. 

* I have animated the transitions for my circles' locations as well as the range of my axes. 

* I have added tooltips to my circles and displayed each tooltip with the data that the user has selected using the `d3-tip.js` plugin.
